# categorizeus.users.naive

Rudimentary google oauth spec based on : https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2WebServer
https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/ such documentation

note : 

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=

for google oauth to work ~/projects/secrets/secrets.properties needs to have these properties, much documentation to go - master on accession got out of synch, so decided to merge before finishing up generalization of even the naive version, which was the purpose of doing such a rough implementation, to ensure what needs to be in the schema

this was a schema change, docs needed
